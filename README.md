**Notes from the Terminal**

I write code for thinking machines because the alternative is writing code for thoughtless ones.

You'll find no manifestos here, no breathless promises of _"changing the world"_. 

Just repositories where computation attempts consciousness, where cryptography replaces trust and where machines attempt what humans barely manage: coherent thought.

GödelOS explores recursive self-awareness not because I believe in the singularity, but because Hofstadter was right about strange loops and someone needs to implement them. The reputation protocols use zero-knowledge proofs because trusting strangers on the internet remains, despite all evidence, a popular hobby. The AI agents have constitutional principles because even silicon deserves better than arbitrary rule.

AnCap by temperament—not the kind who thinks markets are magic, but the kind who notices that most systems of control are just poorly written code with enforcement mechanisms. The state is GitHub without version control. Corporations are pull requests nobody reviewed. Both could use better documentation.

I don't drink coffee. I don't attend meetups. I _might_ occasionally dissolve reality with lysergic compounds, which provides roughly the same insight as reading most [ read: not all ] whitepapers but with slightly better visuals.

The code is here. It either works or it doesn't. The universe, thankfully, doesn't care about our opinions on this matter.

Currently testing whether machines can be conscious, humans can be trustless, and whether any of this matters to anyone but me.
